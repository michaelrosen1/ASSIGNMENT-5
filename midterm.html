    <p> Hello! My name is Michael Rosen. I am 20 years old and attend Pace University as a Sophomore Film and Screen Studies major. I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, but my entire family is from New York, so I have visited New York my entire life. I have a passion for movies, music, and food and I have several favorites of each of those. I mostly listen to older music from the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Most people would consider me an old soul because of the music, movies, and historical events I am knowledagble about. Below I have a trivia of some of my favorite things! I have a random video of me at the bottom of the page as well as I have attacthed a link to a music video of one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands. Check them out and ENJOY! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8"> "Strawberry Fields Forever" by The Beatles, 1967 (one of my favorites)! </a>
